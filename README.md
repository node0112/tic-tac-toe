# tic-tac-toe
My first attempt to create a modular design for a game. I will be trying various new transition and UI elements to improve my familiarity with the code!

After months of coding, the proeject finally came together. I didn't add the computer alogorithm yet but once I do, i will update the readme but till then, this has been my most anticipated project(till now). Hope you like the design and small quirks, have fun!
